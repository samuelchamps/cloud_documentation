 AWS EC2 Beginner Project

Project Overview
This project is my first hands-on experience with AWS EC2.  
The goal was to launch a simple Linux server, secure it properly, connect using SSH, and safely stop it to avoid unnecessary costs.

This project helped me understand how cloud servers work in practice.
